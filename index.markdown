# Welcome to Seb's blog, now updated 


<em>Once More, With Feeling!</em>


## Welcome to SARnet2. 

### Original Vision for this project:

My current website is about three years old at this point and has had the tagline "it'll be ready, when it's ready." For about as long. I think it's high time I fixed that. Thus, this project. I'll be looking at a number of different solutions that I can implement to build a better website.

### Initial Goals for webpage:

In order for me to consider this project somewhat of a success, the SARnet2 should delivier on these goals:

- One size fits all. The website should be mobile friendly, and look good on desktop. SARnet1 does not do this and it is embarrasing!
- SARnet2 will be updated with all projects I've done over the years, with a link to my resume...even if it's basically my resume. 
- Updating shouldn't happen *too* often, but I'd like for it not to be painful, when I do have to do so. 
- Finally, it shouldn't be uglyâ€”the last design was, uh, divisive? Keep the colors clean and dark mode friendly is the goal this time.
