## This is a course I took as a part of the Master of Information Technology program at Florida State Univeristy. You can find the link [here.](https://bitbucket.org/sa17d/lis5916/src/master/)

### Course Description:

This course is an explorative introduction into artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning,
and its associated fields, concepts, and technologies. AI and its related fields are used in a profusion of
diverse areas; from forecasting weather trends, business needs assessments, to medical/health
analytics, computer/security surveillance and protection, farm science, energy production, urban
planning, image and biometric analysis and recognition, as well as many other useful applications. The
possibilities and utilizations of these burgeoning AI fields are limitless.
Just as importantly, the employment opportunities are equally available and lucrative. The foci of this
course will be on the current and relevant trends and applications in these fields, as well as the related
skill sets. The skills, tools, and techniques learned in this course are relevant to careers in the
aforementioned areas.

### Course Objectives: 
At the end of the course, the student will be able to:
- Define terms and concepts used in AI and related fields;
- Create individual development and distributed version control environments;
- Identify characteristics of various intelligent systems;
- Evaluate AI strategies used to address specific practical real-world applications;
- Apply AI techniques on data sets at a basic level.
