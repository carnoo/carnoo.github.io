<em>Twice more, with some substance!</em>

## Hello Again!

My name's Sebastian Angel-Riano. Welcome to my thrid website! I rebuilt this thing from scratch (...again) to replace the abomination that was my first website! This is my second go at this, hence the name S-AR.net2. Very much an in house name, but whatever. 

The purpose of this project is to develop some skills with Ruby, provide a replacement to S-AR.net, and satisfy the requirements of my final project for LIS 5367. But I'd also like to use this space to improve my current website's situation. My current website suffers from being dated, ugly and not mobile friendly
