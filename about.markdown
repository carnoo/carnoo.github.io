# Seb. A-R. Website Overhaul Project 2023


<em>Once More, With Feeling!</em>



## Welcome to the ReadMe of the overhaul project. From here on out, the project will be called SARnet2.

### About this project

My current website is about three years old at this point and has had the tagline "it'll be ready, when it's ready." For about as long. I think it's high time I fixed that. Thus, this project. I'll be looking at a number of different solutions that I can implement to build a better website.

### Goals

In order for me to consider this project somewhat of a success, the SARnet2 should delivier on these goals:

- One size fits all. The website should be mobile friendly, and look good on desktop. SARnet1 does not do this and it is embarrasing!
- SARnet2 will be updated with all projects I've done over the years, with a link to my resume...even if it's basically my resume. 
- Updating shouldn't happen *too* often, but I'd like for it not to be painful, when I do have to do so. 
- Finally, it shouldn't be uglyâ€”the last design was, uh, divisive? Keep the colors clean and dark mode friendly is the goal this time.

### Solutions tested

I'll be starting out with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby Gem that I'll use in conjunction with [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/). I've seen what these two look like in action thanks to the modding group (for Titanfall 2) [Northstar](https://northstar.tf/blog/), and I'll be attempting to emulate their layout while building off of it to suit my needs listed above.
